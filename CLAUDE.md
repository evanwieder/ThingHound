# ThingHound — Agent Instructions

These instructions apply to every agentic session in this repository and override default behavior. For coding standards, see `coding_standards.md` (mandatory — read before writing any code).

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

These are always active. No additional file load required.

- **No floating-point anywhere.** Domain values are `Decimal`; money is `Money`. Physical encoding is DBMS-specific (see `thinghound-architecture.md` §9) but is never a float.
- **`UUIDv7` for all ID fields in domain models.** Use `UUIDv7` from `thinghound.types`. Canonical string only at the bridge boundary (`str(id)`). Never `bytes`, `str`, or `uuid.UUID` in domain models.
- **`foreign_keys = OFF`** on every SQLite connection.
- **Scale per `attribute_definition`**, not per `unit_dimension`.
- **All SQL lives in aggregate mappers.** No SQL in service, domain, UI, or test code.
- **All SQL is parameterized.** No string interpolation of values.
- **Timestamps/dates are stored as epoch integers on SQLite** (epoch milliseconds, UTC), encoded/decoded by the mapper — never `TEXT`. `HLC` stays `TEXT` (causal-clock string). See `thinghound-architecture.md` §9.
- **Logical model is DBMS-agnostic.** Physical constraints for SQLite CRR/LOG tables (DEFAULT on NOT NULL, no cross-column CHECK, etc.) are in `thinghound-architecture.md` §9 and `docs/dev/standards-sql.md`.
- **Do not use `from __future__ import annotations`.** Python 3.14 evaluates annotations lazily by default (PEP 649).

## Task-Routing Rules

Before beginning work in each domain, read the relevant compact standards file:

| Task | Read before starting |
|------|---------------------|
| Writing or reviewing any Python code | `docs/dev/agent/standards-python.md` |
| Writing or reviewing any SQL | `docs/dev/agent/standards-sql.md` |
| Writing or reviewing any data model (Pydantic) | `docs/dev/agent/standards-data-models.md` |
| Writing or reviewing any mapper or repository | `docs/dev/agent/standards-repository.md` AND `docs/dev/agent/standards-sql.md` |
| Writing or reviewing any tests | `docs/dev/agent/standards-testing.md` |
| Writing any error handling | `docs/dev/agent/standards-error-handling.md` |

## Project Context

Specifications are in `docs/specs/`:
- `thinghound-functional-spec.md` — requirements, definitions, business rules
- `thinghound-data-model.md` — logical data model (all entities, sync classes, type vocabulary)
- `thinghound-architecture.md` — stack, persistence layers, physical type mapping, sync design

cr-sqlite compatibility rules and empirical findings: `docs/dev/crsqlite-spike-findings.md`.

## Workflow

- All development on branches. Merge to `main` only via user-approved PR.
- Do not start coding unprompted. Wait for explicit instruction.
- Do not push to remote without explicit user authorization.
- Do not create PRs without explicit user authorization.
- Table names are named for what a **single row** represents. Almost all table names are therefore singular (`item`, `category`, `inventory_event`). A table name is plural only when each row itself represents a collection — which is rare. When uncertain: if one row = one thing, the name is singular. Index name tokens follow the same rule.
